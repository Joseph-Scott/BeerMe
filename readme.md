~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description:

Welcome to BeerMe! We've created a wep application that allows you to search for craft beer
breweries in the Atlanta area, as well as the specific popular beers that they brew. Using 
an API created from the treasure trove of craft beer information on BeerAdvocate, our app 
brings the world of Atlanta craft beer to your fingertips with a versatile search module 
to find that one great beer you're looking for as well as Google mapping which allows you 
to find the location of the brewery where it was made. Enjoy!
